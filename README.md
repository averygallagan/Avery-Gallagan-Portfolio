# Avery-Gallagan-Portfolio
Week Two Challenge- Portfolio

This week we were tasked with creating a portfolio containing some projects, as well as contact information. 

The nav bar items when clicked on will bring you to the appropriate section of the page.

When you hover over the cards in the work section, they will become highlighted. If we had some of these projects done, they would have links directing you to the project. 

The contact me section has multiple links within it. 

I added a resume section on the bottom of the page but i dont have a resume to link to it. 

The link to the site is: https://averygallagan.github.io/Avery-Gallagan-Portfolio/
